# Deprecated Season Files

These files are legacy, pre-calendar spine formats and are no longer canonical.
The canonical date-driven season/week structure now lives in:

- `data/seasons.json`
- `data/blocks.json`
- `data/weeks.json`

Keep these files for historical reference only. Do not edit or consume them in production tooling.
