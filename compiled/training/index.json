    "body": "# Heat Training Fundamentals\n\nHeat acclimation is a critical skill for ultrarunners, especially those racing in hot climates. Here's how to build heat tolerance safely:\n\n## The Science\n\nYour body needs 10-14 days of consistent heat exposure to fully adapt. During this period, your blood plasma volume increases, sweating begins earlier and at a higher rate, and your core temperature threshold rises.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. **Start Conservatively**: Begin with 20-30 minute sessions at reduced intensity\n2. **Gradual Progression**: Add 5-10 minutes each session until you're hitting 60-90 minutes\n3. **Monitor Hydration**: Weigh yourself before and after runs to dial in fluid needs\n4. **Timing Matters**: Train during the hottest part of the day (12-3 PM)\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n- Never train alone in extreme heat\n- Carry extra water and electrolytes\n- Know the signs of heat exhaustion: dizziness, nausea, confusion\n- Back off if your heart rate is 10+ bpm higher than normal for a given effort\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n- Overdressing indoors can simulate heat when weather doesn't cooperate\n- Hot baths (15-20 min at 104°F) post-run can supplement outdoor sessions\n- Don't schedule heat training during high-volume weeks\n\nRemember: heat training is a tool, not a daily requirement. Use it strategically in your build to a goal race.",

    "body": "# Fueling Strategy 101: Energy Systems\n\n## Your Body's Fuel Tanks\n\nThink of your body as having three fuel tanks:\n\n### 1. Phosphocreatine (PCr) System\n- **Duration**: 0-10 seconds\n- **Use case**: All-out sprints, explosive efforts\n- **Fueling**: Not relevant for ultras\n\n### 2. Glycolytic System (Carbs)\n- **Duration**: 10 seconds - 2 minutes at max, but sustains moderate-hard efforts\n- **Storage**: ~2000 calories (liver + muscle glycogen)\n- **Use case**: Tempo runs, threshold efforts, hard climbs\n- **Fueling needs**: 60-90g carbs/hour during racing\n\n### 3. Oxidative System (Fat)\n- **Duration**: Unlimited (practically)\n- **Storage**: 50,000+ calories for most runners\n- **Use case**: Easy runs, recovery, ultra pace\n- **Fueling needs**: Minimal external fuel needed if trained\n\n## The Zone 2 Sweet Spot\n\nAt ultra pace (Zone 2-3), you're burning roughly:\n- 60-70% fat\n- 30-40% carbs\n\nThis is why base building matters—you're training your body to preferentially burn fat, sparing glycogen for when you need it.\n\n## Racing Implications\n\n**Key insight**: Even fat-adapted runners need carbs during races because:\n1. Any intensity above pure Zone 2 requires glycogen\n2. Your gut can only absorb ~60-90g carbs/hour\n3. You're burning ~400-600 cal/hour\n4. Fat oxidation can't keep pace with demand\n\n**Next up**: Part 2 will cover practical fueling protocols for training and racing.\n\n---\n\n*This is part of our Fueling Strategy 101 series. Stay tuned for Part 2: Race Day Fueling Tactics.*",

    "body": "# Building Vertical Tolerance\n\nMountain ultras demand specific adaptations. Here's how to build climbing strength and eccentric resilience progressively.\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)\n\n**Goal**: Build basic climbing endurance without destroying your legs\n\n- **Volume**: 1-2 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 1,000-2,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: 4-8% sustained climbs\n- **Effort**: Conversational pace (Zone 2)\n- **Recovery**: Gentle downhills, walk the steeps\n\n## Phase 2: Load (Weeks 5-8)\n\n**Goal**: Increase vertical volume and introduce steeper grades\n\n- **Volume**: 2-3 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 2,000-4,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: Mix of 4-8% and 8-12% pitches\n- **Effort**: Mostly Zone 2, some Zone 3 on climbs\n- **Recovery**: Start running moderate downhills\n\n## Phase 3: Specificity (Weeks 9-12)\n\n**Goal**: Simulate race-day vert and grade\n\n- **Volume**: 2-3 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 3,000-6,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: Race-specific (include 12%+ if racing steep terrain)\n- **Effort**: Zone 2-3 on climbs, practice race-day effort\n- **Recovery**: Run all downhills at race effort\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Progression is Non-Linear**: Some weeks step back in volume\n2. **Downhills Build Slowly**: Eccentric damage is real—respect it\n3. **Power Hiking**: Don't force running on steep grades (>12%)\n4. **Strength Work**: Add single-leg exercises to bulletproof knees\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Too much vert too soon\n❌ Ignoring downhill practice\n❌ Running when you should hike\n❌ Skipping strength work\n\n## Sample Week (Phase 3)\n\n- **Monday**: Easy 60 min flat\n- **Tuesday**: Vert workout: 4,000 ft climbing (Zone 2-3)\n- **Wednesday**: Recovery 45 min\n- **Thursday**: Tempo run with rolling hills\n- **Friday**: Rest or easy 30 min\n- **Saturday**: Long run with 2,000-3,000 ft vert\n- **Sunday**: Easy 60-90 min\n\n**Remember**: Vert training is cumulative. Your body adapts slowly to eccentric load. Be patient and consistent.",
