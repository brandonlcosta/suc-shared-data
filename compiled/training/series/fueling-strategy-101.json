    "body": "# Fueling Strategy 101: Energy Systems\n\n## Your Body's Fuel Tanks\n\nThink of your body as having three fuel tanks:\n\n### 1. Phosphocreatine (PCr) System\n- **Duration**: 0-10 seconds\n- **Use case**: All-out sprints, explosive efforts\n- **Fueling**: Not relevant for ultras\n\n### 2. Glycolytic System (Carbs)\n- **Duration**: 10 seconds - 2 minutes at max, but sustains moderate-hard efforts\n- **Storage**: ~2000 calories (liver + muscle glycogen)\n- **Use case**: Tempo runs, threshold efforts, hard climbs\n- **Fueling needs**: 60-90g carbs/hour during racing\n\n### 3. Oxidative System (Fat)\n- **Duration**: Unlimited (practically)\n- **Storage**: 50,000+ calories for most runners\n- **Use case**: Easy runs, recovery, ultra pace\n- **Fueling needs**: Minimal external fuel needed if trained\n\n## The Zone 2 Sweet Spot\n\nAt ultra pace (Zone 2-3), you're burning roughly:\n- 60-70% fat\n- 30-40% carbs\n\nThis is why base building matters—you're training your body to preferentially burn fat, sparing glycogen for when you need it.\n\n## Racing Implications\n\n**Key insight**: Even fat-adapted runners need carbs during races because:\n1. Any intensity above pure Zone 2 requires glycogen\n2. Your gut can only absorb ~60-90g carbs/hour\n3. You're burning ~400-600 cal/hour\n4. Fat oxidation can't keep pace with demand\n\n**Next up**: Part 2 will cover practical fueling protocols for training and racing.\n\n---\n\n*This is part of our Fueling Strategy 101 series. Stay tuned for Part 2: Race Day Fueling Tactics.*",
