    "body": "# Sleep Optimization for Ultras\n\nSleep is your most powerful recovery tool. Here's how to optimize it for ultra training and racing.\n\n## The Science\n\n**What Happens During Sleep:**\n- Growth hormone release (muscle repair)\n- Glycogen replenishment\n- Immune system strengthening\n- Neural pathway consolidation\n- Inflammation reduction\n\n**Research shows:**\n- <7 hours sleep = 30% increased injury risk\n- Poor sleep = reduced time to exhaustion\n- Sleep debt accumulates and can't be \"caught up\" on weekends\n\n## Training Phase Sleep Targets\n\n### Base Building\n- **Target:** 8-9 hours nightly\n- **Why:** Maximum adaptation to aerobic stimulus\n- **Priority:** Consistency over quantity\n\n### Build/Peak Weeks\n- **Target:** 9+ hours nightly\n- **Why:** Harder training requires more recovery\n- **Strategy:** Add 30-60 min nap on hard training days\n\n### Taper\n- **Target:** 8-9 hours (same as base)\n- **Why:** Sleep debt repayment, nervous system priming\n- **Note:** Don't oversleep—disrupts circadian rhythm\n\n## Sleep Hygiene Protocols\n\n### 3 Hours Before Bed\n- Finish eating (digestion disrupts sleep)\n- Limit fluids (reduce bathroom trips)\n- No alcohol (ruins REM sleep)\n\n### 1 Hour Before Bed\n- Dim lights (triggers melatonin)\n- Cool room to 65-68°F\n- Blue light blocking (glasses or screen filters)\n- Light reading or meditation\n\n### Bedtime\n- Same time every night (±30 min)\n- Dark room (blackout curtains or eye mask)\n- White noise if needed\n- No phone in bedroom\n\n## Race Week Sleep Strategy\n\n**Days 7-3 Before Race:**\n- Maintain normal schedule\n- 8-9 hours nightly\n- Avoid sleep debt\n\n**Days 2-1 Before Race:**\n- Don't stress about poor sleep (normal pre-race anxiety)\n- Focus on relaxation over forcing sleep\n- The sleep 2 nights before matters most\n\n**Race Night (for 100M):**\n- If racing through night, nap 2-3 hours in afternoon\n- Don't change sleep schedule week before\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Training late (within 3 hours of bedtime)\n❌ Inconsistent sleep schedule\n❌ Alcohol to \"help\" sleep\n❌ Overthinking one bad night\n❌ Napping too late (after 3 PM)\n\n## When to Nap\n\n**Best practices:**\n- 20-30 min power nap (avoid sleep inertia)\n- Between 1-3 PM (aligns with circadian dip)\n- After hard workouts\n- Never as replacement for nightly sleep\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Treat sleep as seriously as your training. It's not recovery if you're not sleeping.",
