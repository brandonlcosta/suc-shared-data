    "body": "# Building Vertical Tolerance\n\nMountain ultras demand specific adaptations. Here's how to build climbing strength and eccentric resilience progressively.\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)\n\n**Goal**: Build basic climbing endurance without destroying your legs\n\n- **Volume**: 1-2 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 1,000-2,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: 4-8% sustained climbs\n- **Effort**: Conversational pace (Zone 2)\n- **Recovery**: Gentle downhills, walk the steeps\n\n## Phase 2: Load (Weeks 5-8)\n\n**Goal**: Increase vertical volume and introduce steeper grades\n\n- **Volume**: 2-3 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 2,000-4,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: Mix of 4-8% and 8-12% pitches\n- **Effort**: Mostly Zone 2, some Zone 3 on climbs\n- **Recovery**: Start running moderate downhills\n\n## Phase 3: Specificity (Weeks 9-12)\n\n**Goal**: Simulate race-day vert and grade\n\n- **Volume**: 2-3 vert sessions per week\n- **Target**: 3,000-6,000 ft per session\n- **Grade**: Race-specific (include 12%+ if racing steep terrain)\n- **Effort**: Zone 2-3 on climbs, practice race-day effort\n- **Recovery**: Run all downhills at race effort\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Progression is Non-Linear**: Some weeks step back in volume\n2. **Downhills Build Slowly**: Eccentric damage is real—respect it\n3. **Power Hiking**: Don't force running on steep grades (>12%)\n4. **Strength Work**: Add single-leg exercises to bulletproof knees\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Too much vert too soon\n❌ Ignoring downhill practice\n❌ Running when you should hike\n❌ Skipping strength work\n\n## Sample Week (Phase 3)\n\n- **Monday**: Easy 60 min flat\n- **Tuesday**: Vert workout: 4,000 ft climbing (Zone 2-3)\n- **Wednesday**: Recovery 45 min\n- **Thursday**: Tempo run with rolling hills\n- **Friday**: Rest or easy 30 min\n- **Saturday**: Long run with 2,000-3,000 ft vert\n- **Sunday**: Easy 60-90 min\n\n**Remember**: Vert training is cumulative. Your body adapts slowly to eccentric load. Be patient and consistent.",
