    "body": "# Hydration Systems Compared\n\nChoosing how to carry water is as personal as shoe selection. Let's break down the options.\n\n## Hydration Vests\n\n**Pros:**\n- Hands-free running\n- Carry 1-3L capacity\n- Storage for nutrition, layers, mandatory gear\n- Weight distributed across shoulders and torso\n\n**Cons:**\n- Expensive ($100-200)\n- Can feel bulky on hot days\n- Requires proper fit\n- Cleaning bladder is tedious\n\n**Best for:** 50K+ races, self-supported long runs, mountain courses\n\n**Top picks:** Salomon ADV Skin 12, Ultimate Direction Fast Pack\n\n## Handhelds\n\n**Pros:**\n- Quick sip access\n- Lightweight and minimal\n- Easy to refill at aid stations\n- Natural arm swing cadence\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited capacity (500ml typically)\n- Hand fatigue on long efforts\n- Awkward for technical terrain\n- Minimal storage\n\n**Best for:** Training runs under 2 hours, supported races with close aid, flat courses\n\n**Top picks:** Nathan SpeedDraw Plus, Salomon Soft Flask\n\n## Hydration Belts\n\n**Pros:**\n- Lower center of gravity than vest\n- Less bounce than vest (when fitted right)\n- Cooler on hot days\n- Modular flask system\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited capacity (usually 2 flasks max)\n- Can ride up or bounce if poorly fitted\n- Less storage than vest\n- Learning curve for comfort\n\n**Best for:** 50K races, hot weather events, runners who hate vest bounce\n\n**Top picks:** Naked Running Band, FlipBelt\n\n## My Recommendation\n\n**Training:** Handheld for runs under 90 minutes, vest for anything longer\n\n**Racing:**\n- **50K**: Vest or belt depending on aid station spacing\n- **50M-100K**: Vest (non-negotiable for safety)\n- **100M**: Vest with 2L+ capacity\n\n## Hydration Strategy\n\nRegardless of system:\n- Drink to thirst (20-24 oz/hour baseline)\n- Add electrolytes to every bottle\n- Practice in training at race effort\n- Refill at every aid station opportunity\n\n**Pro tip:** In a vest, use soft flasks in front pockets for quick access. Save bladder for backup capacity.",
