    "body": "# Downhill Resilience\n\nDownhills are where races are won and quads are blown. The goal is to build eccentric tolerance without adding injury risk.\n\n## The 3-Part Progression\n\n### 1. Strength Base (2-3x/week)\n- Split squats: 3x8 each side\n- Step-downs: 3x10 each side (slow 4-5 sec lowering)\n- Calf raises: 3x12 (pause at bottom)\n\n### 2. Controlled Exposure (1x/week)\n- Short downhill repeats: 6-10 x 45-60 sec\n- Easy effort, focus on cadence and soft footstrike\n- Walk back up for full recovery\n\n### 3. Specificity (every 10-14 days)\n- 20-40 min continuous downhill on runnable grade\n- Effort stays conversational\n- Stop if form breaks down\n\n## Form Cues\n- Quick feet (aim 175-185 cadence)\n- Slight forward lean from ankles\n- Land under hips, not out in front\n\n## Recovery Rules\n- Expect soreness for 24-48 hours after new downhill load\n- Prioritize easy running the next day\n- No back-to-back hard downhill sessions\n\n## Race Week Tip\nDo one short downhill refresher 7-10 days out, then let your legs absorb it.\n\n**Bottom line:** Build downhill fitness gradually, and you will gain speed without the quad shutdown.",
