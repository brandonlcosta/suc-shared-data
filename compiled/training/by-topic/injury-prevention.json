    "body": "# Bulletproofing Your Knees\n\nKnee pain sidelines more ultrarunners than any other injury. Here's how to build resilient, bombproof knees.\n\n## Why Knees Fail\n\n**The Culprits:**\n1. Weak glutes (poor hip stability)\n2. Quad dominance (imbalanced leg strength)\n3. Tight IT band and TFL\n4. Poor eccentric strength (downhill running)\n5. Overstriding (excessive braking forces)\n\n## The Essential 4 Exercises\n\nDo these 2-3x per week, year-round:\n\n### 1. Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (RDL)\n\n**Why:** Builds glute and hamstring strength, improves hip stability\n\n**How:**\n- Stand on one leg, slight knee bend\n- Hinge at hip, reach opposite hand toward floor\n- Keep back flat, standing leg heel planted\n- Feel stretch in hamstring\n- Return to standing, squeeze glute\n\n**Progression:**\n- Bodyweight: 3x12 each leg\n- Dumbbell: 3x10 each leg (10-25 lbs)\n- Advanced: 3x8 each leg (30-40 lbs)\n\n### 2. Terminal Knee Extensions (TKEs)\n\n**Why:** Strengthens VMO (inner quad), stabilizes patella\n\n**How:**\n- Loop resistance band around sturdy anchor at knee height\n- Step into band, position behind knee\n- Slight bend in knee to start\n- Squeeze quad, straighten leg fully\n- Slow return to start\n\n**Progression:**\n- Light band: 3x15 each leg\n- Medium band: 3x12 each leg\n- Heavy band: 3x10 each leg\n\n### 3. Step-Downs\n\n**Why:** Builds eccentric strength for downhill running\n\n**How:**\n- Stand on step/box (6-12 inches high)\n- Slowly lower opposite heel toward ground (5 sec descent)\n- Tap floor lightly, return to start\n- Keep knee tracking over 2nd toe\n- No knee valgus (inward collapse)\n\n**Progression:**\n- 6\" box: 3x10 each leg\n- 8\" box: 3x12 each leg\n- 12\" box: 3x15 each leg\n- Advanced: Add weight vest\n\n### 4. Clamshells\n\n**Why:** Activates glute medius, prevents IT band syndrome\n\n**How:**\n- Lie on side, knees bent 90°\n- Feet together, open top knee like clamshell\n- Keep pelvis stable (don't rotate back)\n- Pause at top, slow return\n\n**Progression:**\n- Bodyweight: 3x20 each side\n- Light band: 3x15 each side\n- Heavy band: 3x12 each side\n\n## Sample Weekly Integration\n\n**Option A: Pre-Run Activation**\n- 2x10 TKEs each leg\n- 2x15 clamshells each side\n- Takes 5 minutes, primes knees for run\n\n**Option B: Post-Run Strength**\n- Full protocol above\n- 15-20 minutes\n- 2-3x per week\n\n**Option C: Dedicated Strength Day**\n- Full protocol + additional leg work\n- 30-40 minutes\n- 1-2x per week\n\n## Red Flags to Watch\n\n🚨 Sharp pain during exercises → Stop, consult PT\n🚨 Swelling that doesn't resolve overnight → Rest day\n🚨 Pain that alters your gait → See professional\n\n**The Bottom Line:** An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. These exercises take 15 minutes but can save your season.",
