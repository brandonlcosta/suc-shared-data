    "body": "# Trail Shoe Selection Guide\n\nChoosing the right trail shoe can make or break your ultra experience. Here's how to find your perfect match.\n\n## Key Factors\n\n### 1. Terrain Type\n\n**Rocky Technical Trails**\n- Rock plate protection essential\n- Stiffer midsole for foot fatigue\n- Aggressive lugs (4-5mm)\n- Examples: Speedgoat, Altra Olympus\n\n**Smooth Buff Trails**\n- Lighter, more flexible\n- Moderate cushion\n- 3-4mm lugs sufficient\n- Examples: Sense Ride, Pegasus Trail\n\n**Mud & Wet Conditions**\n- Deep, spaced lugs (5-6mm)\n- Water-resistant upper\n- Sticky rubber compound\n- Examples: Speedcross, Peregrine\n\n### 2. Distance Considerations\n\n**50K and Under**\n- Can prioritize responsiveness\n- Less cushion acceptable\n- Stack height: 20-28mm\n\n**50 Miler to 100K**\n- Balance cushion and ground feel\n- Stack height: 28-35mm\n- Consider wider toe box\n\n**100 Milers**\n- Maximum cushion priority\n- Stack height: 33-40mm\n- Room for foot swelling\n- Rocker geometry helps late-race\n\n### 3. Fit Philosophy\n\n**The Thumbnail Test**: Full thumbnail's width between longest toe and shoe end when standing\n\n**Width Matters**: \n- Narrow: Salomon, Nike\n- Medium: Hoka, Brooks\n- Wide: Altra, Topo\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Buying race day shoes without testing in training\n❌ Going too minimal for ultra distance\n❌ Ignoring drop if switching from road shoes\n❌ Not accounting for foot swelling\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n- Buy shoes in the evening when feet are swollen\n- Train in shoes for 40-60 miles before racing\n- Have 2-3 pairs in rotation to extend life\n- Replace every 300-400 miles for ultras\n- Don't change shoes within 4 weeks of race day\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe best shoe is the one that disappears on your feet. Ignore hype and brand loyalty—your feet will tell you what works.",
