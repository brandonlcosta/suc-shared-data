  "description": "This is your longest controlled nutrition rehearsal.\n\nGoal: Have your race kit dialed in. Know what goes in what pocket. Where each bottle is going.\n\nTreat this as a dress rehearsal: nutrition, gear, pacing, terrain — everything.\n\nEarly effort must stay boring and easy (RPE 3-4). This is not a speed day — it’s a gut training day. The final 90-120min may allow light progression if you’re handling fuel well.\n\nLay out your gear and fuel the day before.\n\nTest fluid intake, sodium, gels, calories\n\nGear & pack should mirror race setup\n\nSocks, Shoes, anti chafing, use all your race day gear. No exceptions.",
